## 1. Algorithm Code

Below is the Python code for the `combinationSum2` algorithm:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def findCombinations(ind, arr, target, ans, ds):
            if target == 0:
                ans.append(list(ds))
                return
            
            for i in range(ind, len(arr)):
                if i > ind and arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                    continue
                if arr[i] > target:
                    break
                
                ds.append(arr[i])
                findCombinations(i + 1, arr, target - arr[i], ans, ds)
                ds.pop()
        
        ans = []
        candidates.sort()
        findCombinations(0, candidates, target, ans, [])
        return ans
```

## 2. Step-by-Step Execution Walkthrough

### Initial Setup

- **Input:** `candidates = [2, 5, 2, 1, 2]`, `target = 5`
- **Sorted Array:** After sorting, `arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 5]`

### Recursive Calls and Variable Tables

The algorithm uses a recursive function `findCombinations` to explore all unique combinations. Below is a detailed table for **Call 1**:

**Call 1:** `findCombinations(ind=0, target=5, ds=[])`

| **Step** | **i** | **Candidate (arr[i])** | **Check**                                                      | **Action**                                                                                                                     | **ds (after append/pop)**      | **Remaining Target**         |
|:--------:|:-----:|:----------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1        | 0     | 1                      | No duplicate; 1 ≤ 5                                            | Append `1` to `ds` → `ds = [1]` <br> New target: `5 - 1 = 4` <br> Recurse: `findCombinations(1, 4, [1])`                 | Becomes `[1]` during recursion; then pop back to `[]` | 4 (in recursive call)        |
| 2        | 1     | 2                      | No duplicate; 2 ≤ 5                                            | Append `2` to `ds` → `ds = [2]` <br> New target: `5 - 2 = 3` <br> Recurse: `findCombinations(2, 3, [2])`                 | Becomes `[2]` during recursion; then pop back to `[]` | 3 (in recursive call)        |
| 3        | 2     | 2                      | **Duplicate check:** `i > ind` (2 > 0) and `arr[2]` equals `arr[1]` → Skip | **Skip** this candidate                                                                                                        | `[]` remains                  | 5                            |
| 4        | 3     | 2                      | **Duplicate check:** `arr[3]` equals `arr[2]` → Skip             | **Skip** candidate                                                                                                             | `[]` remains                  | 5                            |
| 5        | 4     | 5                      | 5 ≤ 5                                                          | Append `5` to `ds` → `ds = [5]` <br> New target: `5 - 5 = 0` <br> Recurse: `findCombinations(5, 0, [5])`                  | Becomes `[5]` during recursion; then pop back to `[]` | 0 (in recursive call)        |

Other recursive calls (with their respective tables) detail how `ds`, `target`, and `ind` change as the algorithm explores each branch.

## 3. Understanding the For-Loop

The core of the recursion is the following for-loop:

```python
for i in range(ind, len(arr)):
    if i > ind and arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
        continue
    if arr[i] > target:
        break
    
    ds.append(arr[i])
    findCombinations(i + 1, arr, target - arr[i], ans, ds)
    ds.pop()
```

### Explanation:
- **Iteration:**  
  The loop iterates over candidates starting from `ind` to the end of the array.
  
- **Skipping Duplicates:**  
  The condition:
  ```python
  if i > ind and arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
      continue
  ```
  ensures that if the current candidate is the same as the previous candidate *at the same recursion level*, it gets skipped. This avoids duplicate combinations.

- **Early Termination:**  
  The check:
  ```python
  if arr[i] > target:
      break
  ```
  leverages the sorted order. Once a candidate is greater than the remaining target, no further candidates can contribute to a valid combination, so the loop breaks.

- **Recursive Exploration & Backtracking:**  
  After adding the candidate to `ds`, the function recursively explores further candidates by calling itself with updated parameters. After recursion, it pops the last candidate from `ds` (backtracking) to try the next possibility.

---

## 4. Why is the Condition `i > ind` Necessary?

In the duplicate-check condition:

```python
if i > ind and arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
    continue
```

- **Purpose of `i > ind`:**  
  - **For the first element** at the current recursion level (`i == ind`), the condition is not applied—even if it’s a duplicate from a previous recursive call, it must be considered as a valid starting point.
  - **For subsequent elements** (`i > ind`), if `arr[i]` equals the previous candidate (`arr[i - 1]`), processing it would yield duplicate combinations. Thus, it’s skipped.

This ensures that each unique candidate is only processed once per recursive level, preventing duplicate combinations while still considering valid possibilities.

## 5. Recursive Flow Chart with `ind` Parameter

Below is a flow chart showing the recursive calls along with the changing values of `ind`, `target`, and `ds`:

```
Call 1: findCombinations(ind=0, target=5, ds=[])
├── i = 0: Choose arr[0] = 1  → ds = [1], new target = 5 - 1 = 4
│    └── Call 2: findCombinations(ind=1, target=4, ds=[1])
│         ├── i = 1: Choose arr[1] = 2  → ds = [1,2], new target = 4 - 2 = 2
│         │     └── Call 3: findCombinations(ind=2, target=2, ds=[1,2])
│         │           ├── i = 2: Choose arr[2] = 2  → ds = [1,2,2], new target = 2 - 2 = 0
│         │           │      └── Call 4: findCombinations(ind=3, target=0, ds=[1,2,2])
│         │           │              → target == 0, add [1,2,2] to ans
│         │           ├── i = 3: Duplicate → Skip
│         │           └── i = 4: arr[4] = 5 > 2 → Break
│         ├── i = 2: Duplicate → Skip
│         ├── i = 3: Duplicate → Skip
│         └── i = 4: arr[4] = 5 > 4 → Break
├── i = 1: Choose arr[1] = 2  → ds = [2], new target = 5 - 2 = 3
│    └── Call 5: findCombinations(ind=2, target=3, ds=[2])
│         ├── i = 2: Choose arr[2] = 2  → ds = [2,2], new target = 3 - 2 = 1
│         │     └── Call 6: findCombinations(ind=3, target=1, ds=[2,2])
│         │           └── i = 3: arr[3] = 2 > 1 → Break
│         ├── i = 3: Duplicate → Skip
│         └── i = 4: arr[4] = 5 > 3 → Break
├── i = 2: Duplicate (of candidate 2) → Skip
├── i = 3: Duplicate (of candidate 2) → Skip
└── i = 4: Choose arr[4] = 5  → ds = [5], new target = 5 - 5 = 0
      └── Call 7: findCombinations(ind=5, target=0, ds=[5])
              → target == 0, add [5] to ans
```

Each recursive call increases the `ind` (typically `i + 1`) so that only subsequent candidates are considered, ensuring that the same element is not reused and duplicate combinations are avoided.

## 6. Common Questions & Clarifications

### **Question:**  
*When the for-loop starts with `i = 0` and `ind = 0`, after calling `ds.append(arr[i])` and the subsequent recursive call, does the for-loop in the parent start over at 0 or continue?*

### **Answer:**  
Each recursive call creates a new function context:
- **Parent Call (`ind = 0`):**  
  The for-loop starts at `i = 0`. When a recursive call is made (e.g., after appending `arr[0]`), it passes `i + 1` (which is 1) to the child call.
- **Child Call (`ind = 1`):**  
  Its for-loop begins at `i = 1`.  
- **After Recursion:**  
  The parent call resumes its loop from where it left off (e.g., `i = 1`).

The recursive call does not reset the parent's loop; it simply runs its own loop starting at the updated index.

## 7. Conclusion

The `combinationSum2` algorithm uses recursion and backtracking to efficiently find all unique combinations that sum to a given target. By:
- Sorting the input array,
- Using a for-loop with careful duplicate checks,
- Employing recursion with an updated starting index (`ind`),
- And backtracking after exploring each branch,

the algorithm avoids duplicate combinations and unnecessary computations.

This README has covered the code, provided detailed variable tables, explained the for-loop and its duplicate-check condition, and illustrated the recursion flow with a comprehensive flow chart. We hope this explanation clarifies the workings of the algorithm!
