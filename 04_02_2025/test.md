## **Quiz Questions and Feedback**

### **1. Python Fundamentals**
1. **Lists vs Tuples:** Correct. Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.  
2. **Shallow vs Deep Copy:** Not answered. Feedback: Shallow copy duplicates top-level objects; deep copy duplicates nested objects as well.  
3. **List vs NumPy Array:** Not answered. Feedback: NumPy arrays support vectorized operations for better performance in numerical computations.  
4. **zip() Function:** Incorrect. Feedback: The zip() function combines iterables element-wise into tuples (not for compressing files).  
5. **Lambda Functions:** Partially correct. Feedback: Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword (e.g., `lambda x: x*2`).  
6. **Decorators in Python:** Not answered. Feedback: A decorator is a function that modifies another function's behavior using the `@decorator` syntax.  
7. **__init__ vs __new__:** Not answered. Feedback: `__new__` creates an instance; `__init__` initializes it after creation.  
8. **Factorial Function (Recursive):** Incorrect implementation provided. Feedback: Correct recursive implementation is:
   ```python
   def factorial(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 1
       return n * factorial(n-1)
   ```
9. **Broadcasting in NumPy:** Not answered. Feedback: Broadcasting allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes by expanding smaller arrays to match shapes.
10. **Handling Missing Data in Pandas:** Correct but needs more detail.

### **2. Data Manipulation & Pandas**
11. **Purpose of a DataFrame:** Correct but basic; could elaborate on its structure and versatility.
12. **apply() vs map():** Partially correct; map() is specific to Series, while apply() works on both Series and DataFrames.
13. **Merging DataFrames:** Incorrect; merging is done with `merge()` for key-based joins or `concat()` for stacking.
14. **Replacing Missing Values with Median:** Correct but incomplete; needs to show computation of the median before filling.
15. **dropna() vs fillna():** Correct but basic; could include additional details like parameters (`axis`, `thresh`) for dropna().

---

### **3. Machine Learning Basics & Frameworks**
16. **scikit-learn Purpose:** Correct but basic; scikit-learn also provides tools for preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
17. **Train-Test Split Purpose:** Correct but could emphasize avoiding overfitting.
18. **Grid Search:** Partially correct; grid search systematically tests hyperparameter combinations.
19. **K-Fold Cross Validation:** Partially correct; needs clarification on splitting data into k folds and iterating training/testing.
20. **Logistic Regression vs Linear Regression:** Partially correct; logistic regression predicts probabilities using a sigmoid function.

---

### **4. Deep Learning & Neural Networks**
26. **Neural Network Definition:** Too vague; neural networks consist of layers of interconnected neurons processing data through weights and activation functions.
27. **Backpropagation:** Partially correct; backpropagation uses the chain rule to compute gradients for weight updates.
28. **Activation Functions:** Correct but basic; examples include ReLU (hidden layers), sigmoid (binary classification), and softmax (multi-class classification).
29. **CNNs vs RNNs Use Cases:** Correct but could elaborate on broader applications like object detection (CNN) or NLP tasks (RNN).
30. **Vanishing Gradient Problem:** Partially correct; occurs when gradients become too small in deep networks, hindering weight updates.

---

### **5. Generative AI & Deployment**
46. **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):** Not answered; GANs involve a generator and discriminator competing to generate realistic data.
47. **Diffusion Models:** Not answered; diffusion models generate data by iteratively denoising noisy inputs into coherent outputs.
48. **Recommender Systems (Content-Based):** Partially correct; content-based filtering uses item features to recommend similar items based on user preferences.
49. **Autoencoders in Generative Modeling:** Not answered; autoencoders learn compressed representations of data and can generate new samples from latent space.
50. **Deploying ML Models with APIs (Flask):** Partially correct; Flask is used to create RESTful API endpoints for serving model predictions.

---

## **Action Plan for Improvement**
- Focus on advanced topics like GANs, diffusion models, transfer learning, autoencoders, and deployment techniques.
- Practice coding examples for concepts like cross-validation, PCA, and Flask-based API deployment.
- Review foundational ML concepts such as regularization (L1/L2), bias-variance tradeoff, and feature engineering.

## Example Code Snippets

### Deploying ML Model with Flask
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

# Load pre-trained model
model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))

# Create Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get input data from request
    data = request.get_json()
    prediction = model.predict([data['features']])
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Autoencoder Example
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Define Autoencoder Architecture
input_dim = 784  # Example input size (e.g., flattened 28x28 image)
encoding_dim = 32

input_img = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
encoded = Dense(encoding_dim, activation='relu')(input_img)
decoded = Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)

autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```
