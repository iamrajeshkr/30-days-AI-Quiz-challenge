## **Questions and Correct Answers**

### **1. Python Fundamentals**
1. **What is the difference between a Python list and a tuple?**  
   *Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, while tuples are immutable and cannot be modified after creation.*

2. **Explain the concept of shallow copy versus deep copy in Python.**  
   *A shallow copy creates a new object but references the same nested objects as the original, while a deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects.*

3. **How does a Python list differ from a NumPy array in handling numerical operations?**  
   *Python lists are general-purpose containers and do not support element-wise operations directly, while NumPy arrays are optimized for numerical computations with vectorized operations.*

4. **What does the built-in function zip() do in Python?**  
   *The `zip()` function combines multiple iterables element-wise into tuples, creating an iterator of paired elements.*

5. **Explain what a lambda function is and give an example.**  
   *A lambda function is an anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. Example: `lambda x: x * 2` doubles the input value.*

6. **What is a Python decorator and how do you use one?**  
   *A decorator is a function that modifies another function’s behavior, applied using the `@decorator` syntax.*

7. **In object-oriented Python, what is the role of the __init__ method versus __new__?**  
   *`__new__` creates an instance of a class, while `__init__` initializes its attributes after creation.*

8. **Write a recursive Python function to compute the factorial of a number.**  
   ```python
   def factorial(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 1
       return n * factorial(n-1)
   ```

9. **What does the term “broadcasting” mean in NumPy?**  
   *Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding smaller arrays to match larger ones.*

10. **How would you handle missing data in a Pandas DataFrame?**  
    *Use `dropna()` to remove rows/columns with missing values or `fillna()` to replace them with statistical measures (mean, median, etc.).*

### **2. Data Manipulation & Pandas**
11. **Describe the purpose of a DataFrame in Pandas.**  
    *A DataFrame is a 2D labeled data structure in Pandas that supports heterogeneous data types and provides tools for data manipulation and analysis.*

12. **What is the difference between apply() and map() functions in Pandas?**  
    *`apply()` works on both Series and DataFrames (row- or column-wise), while `map()` is specific to Series for element-wise transformations.*

13. **How do you merge two DataFrames in Pandas?**  
    *Use `merge()` for key-based joins or `concat()` for stacking along rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`).*

14. **Write a Python code snippet using Pandas that replaces missing values in a column with its median:**  
    ```python
    df['column'] = df['column'].fillna(df['column'].median())
    ```

15. **Explain the difference between dropna() and fillna() methods in Pandas:**  
    *`dropna()` removes rows/columns with missing values, while `fillna()` replaces missing values with specified values (e.g., mean, median).*

### **3. Machine Learning Basics & Frameworks**
16. **What is scikit-learn used for in machine learning?**  
    *Scikit-learn is a library that provides tools for machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, model evaluation, and selection.*

17. **Why do we perform a train-test split on data?**  
    *To evaluate model performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting by separating training from testing.*

18. **Describe what grid search is and how it is used in hyperparameter tuning:**  
    *Grid search systematically tests combinations of hyperparameters to find the best-performing configuration.*

19. **Explain K-Fold Cross Validation and its benefits:**  
    *K-Fold CV splits data into k subsets (folds), training on k-1 folds and testing on the remaining fold iteratively to evaluate model performance robustly.*

20. **How does logistic regression differ from linear regression?**  
    *Logistic regression predicts probabilities for classification tasks using the sigmoid function, while linear regression predicts continuous values.*

### **4. Deep Learning & Neural Networks**
26. **What is a neural network and what are its main components?**  
    *A neural network consists of layers of interconnected neurons that process data through weights, biases, and activation functions.*

27. **Explain the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks:**  
    *Backpropagation calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to weights using the chain rule to update weights during training.*

28. **What is an activation function? Provide two examples:**  
    *An activation function introduces non-linearity into neural networks; examples include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and sigmoid.*

29. **Name common deep learning architectures and describe one use-case for each:**  
    - CNN: Image classification (e.g., detecting objects in photos).  
    - RNN: Time series forecasting or natural language processing.

30. **What is the vanishing gradient problem?**  
    *In deep networks, gradients can become very small during backpropagation, preventing effective weight updates in earlier layers.*

### **5. Generative AI & Deployment**
46. **What are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?**  
    *GANs consist of two networks—a generator that creates synthetic data and a discriminator that distinguishes real from fake data—trained together to improve generation quality.*

47. **Explain how diffusion models generate data:**  
    *Diffusion models start with noise and iteratively denoise it through learned processes to generate coherent outputs like images or text.*

48. **What is content-based filtering in recommender systems?**  
    *Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those previously liked by users based on item features using similarity metrics like cosine similarity.*

49. **What role do autoencoders play in generative modeling?**  
    *Autoencoders learn compressed representations of data; variants like VAEs can generate new samples by decoding points from latent space.*

50. **How can APIs be used to deploy machine learning models? Provide an example using Flask:**  
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    import pickle

    # Load pre-trained model
    model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))

    # Create Flask app
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        data = request.get_json()
        prediction = model.predict([data['features']])
        return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
